# IM
Projet d'influence Maximization ADSA

For our ADSA(Advanced Data Structures Algorithms) lesson, we have decided to realize a project based on graph. The subject of the project is  the influence maximization. To solve that problem we will code an algorithm that will realize the TIM+ in C++. We will try to optimize the algorithm.
